For this week's asasignment, I chose the p5.pattern.js https://github.com/SYM380/p5.pattern/blob/main/p5.pattern.jslibrary
My idea for the assignment was to create a grid and create abstract patterns in each of them. I believe I was able to implement exactly what I had envisioned. 
I found it very challenging to link the library to begin with. I was not aware that I had to download the library and place it near the sketch.js. 
Once I got that working, I also struggled with understanding the syntax of the library. It took me a while to go through the different functions before beginning the code. 
However, once I got a hang of it, I was able to put together the code more easily. 
Overall, I think I had fun doing this, and quite like the outcome of my code. Also, it made me understand the purpose of using libraries, and how it can make coding more complext things easier.
